\arguments{
\item{infiles}{A vector of genome sequence file paths in fasta format. Could
also be multifasta files of predicted Open Reading Frames.}

\item{org}{A valid organism from pubmlst.org. Run \link{listPubmlst_orgs} to
see available ones.}

\item{scheme}{\code{integer}. The scheme id number for a given organism. Run
\link{listPubmlst_schemes} to see available schemes for certain \code{org}.}

\item{schemeFastas}{A vector with the path to fasta sequences from each
loci of the specified mlst scheme. If it is \code{NULL} (default), sequences
are downloaded from \url{http://rest.pubmlst.org} to \code{dir}.}

\item{schemeProfile}{The path to the profile file (.tab). If left \code{NULL}
then it is downloaded from \url{http://rest.pubmlst.org} to \code{dir}.}

\item{write}{\code{character}. One of \code{"new"} (Default), \code{"all"} or
\code{"none"}. The fist one writes only new alleles found (not reported in
pubmlst.org), the second writes all alleles found, and "none" do not write
any file.}

\item{ddir}{A non-existing directory where to download the loci fasta files
in case they are not provided by the user. Default:
\code{paste0('pubmlst','_',org,'_',scheme)}}

\item{fdir}{A non-existing directory where to write fasta files of found
sequences (see \code{write}). (Default:
\code{paste0('alleles','_',org,'_',scheme)}).}

\item{n_threads}{\code{integer}. The number of cores to use. Each job consist
on the process for one genome. Blastn searches will use 1 core per job.}

\item{pid}{Percentage identity threshold to be consider as a novel allele. An
\code{integer} <= 100. (Default: 90).}

\item{scov}{Subject coverage threshold to be consider as a novel allele. A
\code{numeric} between 0 and 1. Not recomended to set it below 0.7 .
(Default 1.0)}
}
\value{
An object of class "mlst", which consists on a list of 2 dataframes.
The first one is the alleles called for the \code{infiles} and the ST
detected, whereas the second is the scheme profile. The "result" data.frame
shows one genome per row and one gene from the selected scheme per column.
The last column is the ST detected for each genome. "NA" values means that
no allele were found in the respective genome. A 'u' (from 'unknown') plus
an integer means that the allele found was not reported in pubmlst.org
database; a fasta file with the new allele is written in this case if
\code{"write"} is set to "new" or "all" (see above). New alleles are
compared with each other so the names are properly chosen in case 2 or more
of those novel alleles were the same (in that cases, the names would be the
same). A number indicates the allele id number of the reported alleles in
pubmlst.org . The second data.frame is the profile definition chosen, the
logic is the same as the first one but in this case rows are the combination
of alleles reported at pubmlst.org . A series of attributes are also given
in the "mlst" object, mainly refering to the parameters used by the function.
